# Implementing a design from scratch

## Overview
In this project, we implemented from scratch, without any library, a web page using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge that we learned previously.

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

The project also aims to connect UI Design wireframing based on a Figma file with HTML and ultimately CSS.

We will be adding color, fonts, element positioning using CSS and embedding images and videos in the file to make it visually dynamic.

## Key Topics
The following topics are covered in the project without the use of Javascript ot CSS framework:

### HTML Semantics

### CSS
* media queries
